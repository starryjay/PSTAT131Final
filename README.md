# PSTAT131Final

This is a project I completed for my PSTAT 131 - Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning class at UCSB. 

The full project report is available at PSTAT-131-Final-Project.html.

You can view the R Markdown file that was knitted into the completed HTML file at PSTAT 131 Final Project.Rmd.

The weather_codebook.txt file contains information on each of the columns in my dataset.

The .RData files are saved versions of each of my models: a regression decision tree, a random forest with bootstrap 
aggregation, a boosted trees model, and a linear regression model.

DecisionTree.txt contains a Google Drive link to the full visualization of my regression decision tree model. Since the
image was 1.09 GB in size, I could not include it in the final project. As such, I included a screenshot instead. 

weatherdatanew.csv is my raw data file. Data was collected from Weather Underground and cleaned manually. 

eda.R is my Exploratory Data Analysis file.
